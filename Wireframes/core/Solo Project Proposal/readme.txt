        Description:

Everyone gets overwhelmed when it comes to groceries. Sometimes you forget to buy something, or you don't know how much money you need to buy all the groceries you want. This app helps you manage your grocery list so you don't forget anything anymore, and you'll be financially ready.

Features:

You can add new products by providing the name, type (fruits, cleaning supplies, etc.), and price.
You'll have a list of all the products with the information you provided, along with the total price of all the products so you can easily manage them.
You can modify any details of the products.
You can delete any product.
You can check off any product once you have bought it or uncheck it (the price of the product will be deducted when checked and added when unchecked).
Your list will remain even when you re-enter the app.
